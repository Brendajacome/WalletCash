Project Description:
---
In this program what is requested is to program a digital wallet that is able to receive a
numerical input data with two different buttons, one to pay and one to sell, depending on the
selected button the amount in the wallet will increase or decrease, it should be noted that it will
start with an amount of $ 100, in turn, each action performed must have a unique "ID", that is to
say, that should not be repeated, the date and time at which the action was performed and finally
the amount of such action.
To do this we will use the application "Apache NetBeans IDE" version 12.2, with the
java language, version 17.0.1.
